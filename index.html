              <h2>Stability</h2>
                <p>The computer programming and developing career field has a constant demand, and is always growing.  The world is becoming more and more reliant on computerts for just about every task.  With a few clicks of a mouse or touches on a screen you can do just about anything whether it be ordering food, buying a car, attending a virtual doctor visit, or even submitting school work.  With all the reliance on computers for daily task and work to get done, it has created a very stable industry for programers and developers. Stability is the first and most important reason for me to switch over to this career path.</p>
